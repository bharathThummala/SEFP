Which is the best?USE CASES ,USER STORIES AND SRS              

User Stories are easy for the user to understand.It's incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and doesn't handle exceptional cases because not a lot of effort is expended making sure it's correct. During development, it serves as a reminder and a starting point for additional discussions with the customer about the full extent of his needs.
                             A use case is more complex and is written by the developer in cooperation with the customer but it handle all possible cases. A lot of effort it expended to make sure it's correct. Use are not fully understood by the customers.
                             An SRS minimizes the time and effort required by developers to achieve desired goals and also minimizes the development cost. A good SRS defines how an application will interact with system hardware, other programs and human users in a wide variety of real-world situations. But it is more complex and lengthy.
                           
                      User stories are better for users and SRS is better for developers as it provides concrete understanding.
