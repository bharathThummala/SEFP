Written by: (Team 6)
(Kanv Kumar, Syam Patnala, T Bharat, Sai Teja)


1 Introduction

The team members consists of 4 students of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Sricity. We are trying to build a game engine which can be used by illeterate people so that they can learn from the games generated by the game engine. The idea is to get the input from the user like what type of game the user wants to learn from, language which the user wants in the game, difficulty level of the game,etc and finally this game will be displayed for playing as per user requirements. 

2 Overview

Designing a game factory for illeterate people which will generate 4 games for the user to play. These games are 2d games. 

2.1 Customers

Users will be the illeterate people who want to learn something using the games generated by the game engine.
 
2.2  Functionality

The game engine provides an interface to the user which collects the user input. 
With this input we generate games according to their 
specifications/requirements.                                      

Also they can use these for learning purpose.

2.3 Platform
It is an application on the PC which is a game engine.

2.4 Development Responsibility

Kanv Kumar & Syam Patnala are responsible for studying 2 game engine's source files and trying to build another similar game engine.
T Bharath & Sai Teja are responsible for searching the technologies to be used for the designing of the game engine.

3 Goals and Scope

The main Goal of the application is to make the illeterate people educated to some extent
 The final release will be having features like Scoreboard, levels, High score, unlockable levels.....

5 Risk Management

5.1 Risk Identification

Main risk is to modify the existing libraries of the source code and modify them accoriding to our requirements so that it is transformed into a game factoy. 

5.2 Risk Mitigation

We can take advice from the people who have worked on designing the games,
game libraries so that modifications will be made with less inconsistency and errors.
